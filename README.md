# 🌱 TestGarden

*TestGarden* is a learning environment for becoming a software tester by practicing observation, thinking, and responsibility — not only tools.

Instead of starting from automation or theory, TestGarden starts where real testing starts:

> learning to see.

The platform guides learners step-by-step from exploration to professional judgement, and eventually towards automation and AI collaboration.

## 🎯 Purpose

TestGarden exists to teach testing as a human skill first.

Modern tooling makes it easy to click buttons and generate tests, but much harder to understand:

- what matters
- what risks exist
- what should be tested
- what should not be automated
- and who we protect when we test

TestGarden focuses on developing *testers, not tool operators*.

## 🧭 Learning Path

The curriculum follows a gradual growth model:

1. *Observation* — noticing behaviour and inconsistencies
2. *Bug reporting* — communicating findings clearly
3. *Risk thinking* — prioritizing what matters
4. *System understanding* — regression and evidence
5. *Automation awareness* — choosing what to automate
6. *Ethics* — responsibility and impact
7. *AI collaboration* — working with intelligent systems critically

Each module builds judgement before technique.
